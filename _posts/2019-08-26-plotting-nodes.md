Recently, I had to plot some molecular wave function nodes for a paper we were working on.
My goal was to illustrate the change in nodal structure from HF to exact nodes.
Here we will go through the steps to achieve this.
Examples files are available [here](/post-data/2019-08-26-plotting-nodes/post.tar.gz).

1. Using [PySCF](https://github.com/pyscf/pyscf) for oxygen atom (O.py), run HF and large CASSCF (for "exact" nodes).

2. Convert these wave functions to [QWalk](https://github.com/QWalk/mainline) format using [autogenv2](https://github.com/lkwagner/autogenv2) (done at the end of O.py files).

3. Run QWalk VMC method for a few steps to get reasonable walker positions. 
Use approximately ~10 walkers, since you might want to try different walkers to plot the wave function nodes since they depend on the electron positions. 
This is similar to a 3D object having different 2D shadows depending on the orientation (qwalk.hf).
```
method { VMC
         NCONFIG 10
         NSTEP 100
         NBLOCK 100
}
include qwalk.sys
trialfunc { include qwalk.slater }
```


4. Use QWalk NODES method to scan the space. 
One can use 1 electron or 2 (up and down) electrons to scan. 
Here we use 2 electron scan since this will show higher features of the nodes.
To do this use `DOUBLEMOVES` keyword. 
Note that NODES method will use the very first walker from .config file.
`CONTOURS` will pick which electrons to use in the scan.
QWalk will list all spin up electrons and then all spin down electrons in .config files.
Here we use 1st (up) and 6th (down) electrons.
```
method {
    NODES
    resolution 0.05
    minmax {-5.0.0 5.0.0 -5.0.0 5.0.0 -5.0.0 5.0.0}
    DOUBLEMOVES { 1 1 1}
    contours { 1 6 }
    readconfig qwalk.hf.config
    label VMC
    #dynamics { UNR }
    storeconfig mynodes.config
}
include qwalk.sys
trialfunc { include qwalk.slater }
```

5. Use [VMD](https://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/current/ig/ig.html) to read the cube files generated by QWalk.
   a) File > New Molecule > Browse > file.cube > Load
   b) Graphics > Represenations > Drawing Method > Isosurface
   c) Set Isovalue:0 and set Draw:Solid Surface
   d) Electron positions can be added by Graphics > Represenations > Drawing Method > CPK. Set Bond Radius:0

6. Save this VMD style by File > Save Visulaization State.
This will allow you to simply Load Visulaization State and not repeat yourself.
I found this very useful since you can edit this script, for instance, change to another file.cube for comparison.
Also this allows you fine tune parameters which might be impossible with GUI, eg, `Sphere Scale:0.05`.
You can also change final image size under `# Display settings` in your script.vmd by adding `display resize 1024 1024`.

7. Load script.vmd for HF and CASSCF cases and File > Render > Tachyon (internal in-memory rendering).
It might be useful to turn on all Light sources for this.

8. I then used Krita to put images together and add text.
